# Using ActivitEase: A Guide
ActivitEase is a lightweight and customizable activity manager, that is intended to keep users continuously working on their interests. You can enter in how often you work on an interest, and how long, and ActivitEase will send notifications to make sure you do so. ActivitEase has it's own built in timer, which you use to keep track of your activity progress. ActivitEase keeps track of how many days you have kept a streak going, which is  a metric for your progress on an Interest. Here's an example.

## Example use of ActivitEase: Meditation Tracker.

In this example, I've decided that I want to meditate 5 times a week for 8 minutes. I'd like a notification once a day to remind me to meditate, and keep me on track. From knowing this, I can click 'Add Interest' on the homepage and initialize my interest.
