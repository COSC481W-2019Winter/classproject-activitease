Steps to getting the app to use our logo:

- Snatch the activitease_foreground.png included in this folder and store it in a findable place (like Desktop?)
- Open Android Studio > res > mipmap > ic_launcher > LEFT CLICK ONE OF THEM ONCE.
- Above Android Studio, click File > New > Image Asset.

- About halfway in the popup box, find the 'Path:' text box, click the folder to the right of it, and go find that png file (stored in that easy to find place?)
- Resize it to about 85%, so that the logo barely touches the circles in the examples to the right.
- Click on the 'Background Layer' tab, select 'Color' within the Asset Type, click that color box and enter 'A61615' in the # value box (should be a red color)
- Hit the next button, then Finish button. 

Doing all of that should have created new files within new folders of the mipmap folder. If you navigate back to the mipmap folder, then the ic_launcher folder, and then opening any of the png files there, you should see what the logo loooks like.

If you have questions, feel free to talk to Anthony about it. He'll try his best.
