# Hobby Tracker

## Problem Statement
A problem we've identified is that people don't form habits that reward them in ways they want to.

## Mission Statement
* Our goal is to encourage people to follow their interests to their end.
* Another goal is to allow people to create goals for themselves and giving them a way to accomplish those on a day by day basis. 


Hobby Tracker is not built for any specific thing, but aimed to let anyone practice something regularly, and
track their progress. For eaxmple, in a case of playing Go, you have to practice almost everyday to improve skills by solving life and death problems. 
The more you practice, the more likely you win a game.
