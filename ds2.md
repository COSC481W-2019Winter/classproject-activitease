## Problem
A problem we've identified is that people don't form habits that reward them in ways they want to. People tend to not realize sometimes how little effort they're putting in to certain activities they might find of interest and want to become better at.

## Solution/s
Our solution is create some kind of app that allows the user to keep track of how much time the're putting into specified hobby/ies. It also helps to encourage/alert the user that they planned to do this certain thing at this certain point in time. Our goal is to encourage people to follow their interests to their end. We want to encourage people to create goals for themselves and give them a way to accomplish those goals on a day by day basis if they would like.

#### Mandatory Requirements:
*1. A user can use the Android app to customize their interest needs in three minutes or less.*\
*2. Users can have multiple 'interests'.*\
*3. An interest has three elements for the user to customize:* 
- How many times a day, week, month, or year a user wants to practice an interest.
- How frequently, if at all, a user wants to be notified from the app to work on their interest.
- A timer, that a user can use to time themselves working on a task. Alternatively, they can\
simply enter that they accomplished their goal. 

*4. A user can track their progress, showing how much time daily they practiced an interest.*
- After practicing an interest, users can make a comment on their practice session. This is good\
for recording things like milestones, accomplishments, etc.. 
- Users can see their "streaks", showing how many days/weeks/years they've kept their practice.
- Line graphs ranging in weeks, months, or years shows practice length per day.
*5. A support page is available that allows the user to send feedback and provides the user with our contact information.*


#### Desirable Requirements:
1. Users can track the time of day, and the time spent, on an interest.
2. App needs to connect to the phoneâ€™s clock, and update when different time zones come in.
3. Users could upload guides/project to an optional forum of guides meant to be compatible with the app.
4. Users can create a priority list for their interests.
5. Ideally, we would port it to Apple.
