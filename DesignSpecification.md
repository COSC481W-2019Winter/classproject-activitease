## Design Specifications

#### Mandatory Requirements:
*1. A user can use the Android app to customize their interest needs in three minutes or less.*\
*2. Users can have multiple 'interests'.*\
*3. An interest has three elements for the user to customize:*
- How many times a day, week, month, or year a user wants to practice an interest.
- How frequently, if at all, a user wants to be notified from the app to work on their interest.
- A timer, that a user can use to time themselves working on a task. Alternatively, they can\
simply enter that they accomplished their goal. \
*4. A user can track their progress, showing how much time daily they practiced an interest.*
- After practicing an interest, users can make a comment on their practice session. This is good\
for recording things like milestones, accomplishments, etc.. 
- Users can see their "streaks", showing how many days/weeks/years they've kept their practice.
- Line graphs ranging in weeks, months, or years shows practice length per day.


#### Desirable Requirements:
- Users can track the time of day, and the time spent, on an interest.
- App needs to connect to the phoneâ€™s clock, and update when different time zones come in.
- Users could upload guides/project to an optional forum of guides meant to be compatible with the app.
- Users can create a priority list for their interests.
- Ideally, we would port it to Apple.
