# Manditory requirements:

## General
- Users can use our app with no prior experience to initialize an interest to fit their needs in three minutes or less.
- All non-home pages have a home button to quickly return to the home page.
## The Home page
- The home page is the starting page when the app is opened.
- The home page shows all interests, their streak counts, how much time is needed for each interest, and how many hours/minutes/seconds - the user has to complete them.
- Users can swipe up and down to view all of their interests.
- Users can click on an interest from the home page to go to that interest’s page.
- At the bottom of the home page is an add interest button. This takes the user to an add interest page.
- The menu button, as well as the add interest button, are always viewable if the user is scrolling through interests.
- The home page also has a side menu button.
- The side menu can be toggled on and off by pressing the side menu button.
## Tracking Interest Activity
- Logging timed activities is incentivized by a streak-based system. Each interest’s streak will be displayed on the homescreen, and on an interest page.
- Users can see the total amount of time (in days, hours, and minutes) spent on an interest.
- After finishing an interest, users can comment on an activity period to record things such as milestones or interesting experiences.
- These comments have the total time logged as well as the day matched with them.
- On an interest page, the user can see the previous days in the week, and their corresponding activity completion.
- Users can monitor their activity completion time on a bar graph, over the span of days, months, and years.
## Interest Time settings
- Users can enter how many times per day, week, month, or even year, a user wants to do an action.
- Users must easily be able to set and change the amount of time they commit to an interest.
- Each interest has a corresponding timer, which shows the time needed for that interest period.
- Timers can be paused and started.
- Near the timer is a “Done” button, which can be pressed preemptively to maintain their streak, but will still record a lack in time.
## Interest Notification Settings
- Users have the option to have push notifications from the application go off for each individual interest.
- Each interest can have its notifications easily disabled or enabled with a toggle button.
- Users can enter in the number of notifications they want for an interest.
- The user can customize the time they want the notification to go off, or have the app default to times, given the number of notifications they want.
- Default notification times are calculated to be sensible, in that:
⋅⋅⋅ They will not go off too early (before 9 am)
⋅⋅⋅ They will not go off too late (after 10:30 pm)
⋅⋅⋅ They will be an event amount of time between one notification to the next
- Users can customize the message of the push notification(s), if and only if that notification has a custom set time.
- Notifications can be quickly added, deleted, or changed easily in each interest’s settings.
