## Problem
A problem we've identified is that people don't form habits that reward them in ways they want to. People tend to not realize sometimes how little effort they're putting in to certain activities they might find of interest and want to become better at.

## Solution/s
Our solution is create some kind of app that allows the user to keep track of how much time the're putting into specified hobby/ies. It also helps to encourage/alert the user that they planned to do this certain thing at this certain point in time. Our goal is to encourage people to follow their interests to their end. We want to encourage people to create goals for themselves and give them a way to accomplish those goals on a day by day basis if they would like. 

## Design Specifications

#### Mandatory Requirements:
- *The app must track how often, and for how long, the user wants to work on the interest.*
- *The app must have a timer.*
- *The app must have a notification manager.*
- *App needs to connect to the phoneâ€™s clock, and update when different time zones come in.*
- *Progress can be tracked on a day-by-day basis, and users can comment on their progress on a certain day, if desired.*
- *Users should be able to track multiple interests for different purposes.*
		
#### Desirable Requirements:
- *Ideally, the first three features under mandatory can be done by the user in three minutes or less.*
- *Users can track the time of day, and the time spent, on an interest.*
- *The user can enter their commitment levels, and build a plan to fit their desires.*
- *Users could upload guides/project to an optional forum of guides meant to be compatible with the app.*
- *Users can create a priority list for their interests.*
- *Users can track the time of day, and the time spent, on an interest.*
- *Ideally, we would port it to Apple.*
